# Stopwatch App ‚è±Ô∏è

A simple and precise stopwatch app built using **Flutter & Dart**, featuring real-time time tracking (minutes, seconds, milliseconds), smooth UI transitions, and essential control buttons ‚Äî start, stop, and reset. This project was developed as part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**.
